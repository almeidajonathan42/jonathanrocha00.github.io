				There was once a well-known healer that had the terrible fame of being incredibly arrogant, but also distinguishably skilled in the arts he practiced.
			</p>
			<p class="story">
				Peasants from all over the kingdom came to him hoping to receive some relief from the pains they bore. Most were hopelessly sent back home with gloomy faces, but some had ways to pay what the healer asked and for those a cure was always certain.
				<br/>On that morning destiny brought nothing less than the princess to the healer’s doorstep.
				<br/>“I want to be cured from love,” she commanded.
				<br/>
				<br/>The problem was: there’s no such cure.
				<br/> 
				<br/>But he could never admit that! So the experienced healer faked a smile and hurriedly knelled to kiss her hand.
				“Tell me more about your situation, my princess,” he said soflty, “may I ask you to join me for a tea in my humble shack?”
				<br/>She, obviously, agreed and talked for more than an hour about how some irrelevant human being that captivated her soul and imprisoned her heart.
				<br/>He couldn’t care less… But he had to find a way to get rid of her or, miraculously, cure her…
				<br/>“So, when will my medicine be ready?” She asked sobbing lightly.
